This project needs two-step procedures: (step 1) to train a 'best-trained-model' for transfer learning on the imec case dataset. (step 2) to use the saved 'best-trained-model' to test imec case data.

This notebook 'LSTM_UCI2012Acc_TransferLearning.ipynb' covers the step 1.
This notebook 'imec_Acc_case_application.ipynb' covers the step 2.

Before you run the notebook files, Notice:
(1) the 16 excel files should be put under the folder 'files', they are too large to send by email.
(2) the UCI dataset will be send by using 'Wetransfer' through another email. After download it, put it under the project folder 'imec_case_Acc_LSTM_demo'.
